name: Cargo Cache
description: Cache cargo build files and the registry
inputs:
  cache-group:
    description: |
      The group of the cache, defaults to a unique identifier for the workflow job.
      If you want two jobs to share the same cache, give them the same group name.
    required: false
  cargo-home:
    description: |
      The location of the Cargo cache files.
      If you specify the `CARGO_HOME` env variable for your commands, you need to set it here too.
      This must NOT end with the trailing slash of the directory.
      Defaults to `~/.cargo`.
    required: false
    default: ~/.cargo
  cargo-target-dir:
    description: |
      Location of where to place all generated artifacts, relative to the current working directory. 
      If you specify the `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` env variable for your commands, you need to set it here too.
      This must NOT end with the trailing slash of the directory.
      Defaults to `target`.
    required: false
    default: target
  manifest-path:
    description: |
      The path to `Cargo.toml`. This is used to determine where `Cargo.lock` is, which is used in
      the cache key.
      Defaults to the `Cargo.toml` in the current working directory.
    required: false
    default: "Cargo.toml"
  save-always:
    description: |
      Run the post step to save the cache even if another step before fails.
      Defaults to `true`.
    required: false
    default: "true"
  save-if:
    description: |
      A condition to determine whether the new cache should be saved.
      If it evaluates to `false`, the cache is only loaded.
    required: false
    default: "true"
  sweep-cache:
    description: |
      Use `cargo-sweep` to automatically delete files in the target folder that are not used
      between when this action is called and the end of the workflow. This can prevent the size of
      caches steadily increasing, since new caches are generated from fallback caches that may
      include stale artifacts.
    required: false
    default: "false"
  cache-cargo-sweep:
    description: |
      Only has effect if `sweep-cache` is true. `sweep-cache` works by using `cargo-sweep`, which
      is built using `cargo install`. If `cache-cargo-sweep` is enabled, this action will save the
      resuilting binary to its own cache so that it does not need to be rebuilt.
    required: false
    default: "true"

    description: |
